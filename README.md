## Minimum Spanning Trees (GHS algorithm)
Gallagher-Humblet-Spira (GHS) algorithm is designed for generating a spanning tree T = (V, Eâ€™), such that the sum of the weights of all the edges is minimum. In this exercise, we implemented the GHS algorithm for creating MST networks, and our program is truly distributed that progresses run on 2 machines, each machine executes multiple processes. 

## Running the tests
The test cases we use in this lab are graph2 and graph3. For running the tests, firstly replace your own ip address and file path involved in codes, and then running Nodemulti in one computer and running Nodemulti1 in another computer.
